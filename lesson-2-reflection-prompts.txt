How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    staging area is in the middle of the working directory and the rpository. 
    working directory is where the files saved on your hard drive.
    repository is the git folder to save all your commit version.
    staging area behaves like a tempory storage for the files you wanna commit. You can make a small logical change in part of your file and commit.
    

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    git add: to add file in the staging area
    you can add as many files into the stating area as you decide to commit at one time

    git commit: open the commit editor and enter the message (type i and quit by ese), then save it (type :x! to save or :q! to quit but not save)
